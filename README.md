# ProgDA-Project2020

## Programming for Data Analysis Project 2020

Submission date: 21 December 2020

Objective:

Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Rather than collecting real-world data or using existing data available related to the phenomenon, NumPy's random package should be used to model or synthesise what such a dataset may look like.

Project specifics: 

1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured, and for which at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables can be collected.

2. Investigate the types of variables involved within the phenomenon, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook.

## Traffic & Transport Dataset

For the real-world phenomenon I have decided to look traffic & transport within Galway City. Traffic conjestion is a major issue for Galway, with slow moving traffic & long delays being a regular occurance throughout the city and surrounding areas, particularly at peak times.
This dataset is to be based off the data collected from a hypothetical survey conducted on 200 residents of Galway City. The hypothetical survey centres around traffic and travel behaviours within the City, the data simulated will be loosely based on information & data found from existing traffic & transport surveys.
Please refer to [Traffic.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ProgDA-Project2020/blob/main/Traffic.ipynb) for full description & workings of this project.

## Repository Files & Folders

List of files & folders contained within the Github Repository:

- Images folder - contains image files used within the Jupyter Notebook.
- .gitignore file -  specifies files to be untracked by git.
- ProgDAProject.pdf - full description of the Programming for Data Analysis Project & objectives.
- README.md - This README markdown file.
- Traffic.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file containing all the descriptive & programming objectives of the Project.

## Jupyter Notebook
**Note:** all descriptive & programming objectives of the project have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the [Traffic.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ProgDA-Project2020/blob/main/Traffic.ipynb) within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.

##  Jupyter Notebook Environment

The jupyter notebook can be viewed as a static web page by opening the [Traffic.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ProgDA-Project2020/blob/main/Traffic.ipynb) file directly within this github repository. 

The fully interactive Jupyter notebook can be accessed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), the Python and R programming distribution which includes many data-science specific packages.

1. Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Create a local copy of the Github Repository on your computer, either by downloading the zip file of the repository or by using the Git Clone command, refer to [Github Cloning a Repository Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Open the Anaconda Nagivator via the Windows Start Menu & launch the Jupyter Notebook web application or alternatively by opening terminal (cmd on Windows) & typing ``jupyter notebook``.
4. Within the Jupyter Notebook web application, nagivate to the folder location of the local copy of the repository & open the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file.

**Cloud-Based Services**

Alternatively to downloading & installing  Anaconda & the Jupyter Notebook environment, cloud based servces such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be used to easily run a fully interactive Jupyter notebook in the cloud.

Google Colab is available to anyone with a Google account, it allows for quick creation of notebooks, uploading an existing notebook, or importing a notebook from any public GitHub repository, it comes with most of the commonly used Python libraries pre-installed.

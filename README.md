## Programming for Data Analysis Project 2020

Exploration of Python's NumPy library & in particular the numpy.random package as part of the Programming for Data Analysis Module 2020

Submission date: 21 December 2020
***
Objective:

Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Rather than collecting real-world data or using existing data available related to the phenomenon, NumPy's random package should be used to model or synthesise what such a dataset may look like.

***

Project specifics: 

1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured, and for which at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables can be collected.

2. Investigate the types of variables involved within the phenomenon, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook
Note: all descriptive & programming objectives of the project have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the NumPy.ipynb within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.

## Python Libraries
List of Python Packages & Libraries used within the projet:

- NumPy, numpy.org
- Seaborn, seaborn.pydata.org
- Matplotlib, matplotlib.org
